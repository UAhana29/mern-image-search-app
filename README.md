# MERN Image Search & OAuth Project

This project is a full-stack MERN application built for an internship task. It allows authenticated users to search for images using the Unsplash API, view their search history, and see top searches across all users.

## 🚀 Features
* **Authentication (Req #1):** Secure OAuth login using Google via Passport.js.
* **Top Searches (Req #2):** A dynamic banner showing the top 5 most frequent search terms across all users.
* **Search & Grid (Req #3):** A 4-column image grid of results from the Unsplash API, with a checkbox overlay on each image.
* **Multi-Select Counter (Req #4):** A client-side counter that tracks "Selected: X images" in real-time.
* **Search History (Req #5):** A real-time sidebar showing the logged-in user's personal search history with timestamps.
